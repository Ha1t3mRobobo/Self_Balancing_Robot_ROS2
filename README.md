# ROS 2 Self-Balancing-Robot

## Overview
This repository contains a very simple self-balancing robot implemented using ROS 2 and simulated in gazebo.
The goal of this project is to learn and experiment with sensor feedback,
and control algorithms for balancing robots.

**This project is not yet fully functional**



## Known Issues
- A reliable braking mechanism has not yet been implemented
- Navigation using Nav2 is not fully functional and requires further tuning
- Lidar visualization in Gazebo is glitchy, although the sensor data itself appears to be correct

## TODO
- Improve the implementation of Sliding Mode Control (SMC) for balancing and navigation.
- Implement and evaluate a new balancing algorithm based on LQR.
